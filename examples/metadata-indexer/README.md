# URL Metadata Indexer

This application processes casts on the Farcaster protocol and indexes the metadata of URL embeds found in the casts. Requires the companion open-graph indexer to be running.

## Usage

Modify the environment variable of `app` in `docker-compose.yml` then run with Docker Compose.

```
docker-compose up -d
```
