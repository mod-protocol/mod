# Permissions

Mods can specify `permissions` in their `Manifest`.
Permissions enable Mods to request access to specific data or SDKs, and for integrators of Mod to filter out Mods that require permissions
that they either don't or don't want to support.

## Currently supported permissions

`user.wallet.address` Requests the currently connected user's wallet address as a hex string

`web3.eth.personal.sign` Indicates the Mod needs to be able to callback the App with the parameters of an Ethereum signature.
