# Tailwind + Radix UI (Shadcn)

This is a React UI implementation of Mod renderers for the web, using a combination of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/), and is
being built using [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/). You can see an example using this library [here](https://example-nextjs.modprotocol.org/) and the code for it is [here](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod/tree/main/examples/nextjs-shadcn)

There are some additional steps needed to make sure the configuration is correct when using this library with your repo. These are some temporary quirks while
we figure out a better way to do this.

1. Add to your `tailwind.config.js`

```js
module.exports = {
    // ...rest of your settings
    content: [
        // ...rest of your content rules, order doesn't matter

        // make sure tailwind doesn't tree shake classes used by the library
        "../../packages/react-ui-shadcn/dist/**/*.{ts,tsx,css,js}",
    ],
    plugins: [
        // ...rest of your plugins, order doesn't matter

        // load the text styling
        require("@tailwindcss/typography"),
        // make sure the open popover animations work
        require("tailwindcss-animate")
    ]
}
```

2. If you support the `video-render` Mod, add a global css import to any file where you use the `<RichEmbed/>` component

`import "@mod-protocol/react-ui-shadcn/dist/public/video-js.css"`
