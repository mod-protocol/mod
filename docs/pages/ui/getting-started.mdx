# UI libraries

Mod decouples the UI implementation from the core SDK.
This allows apps to use a UI library that fits their current codebase, or even use their existing codebase components.

Mod currently supports one official UI library: [react-ui-shadcn](/react-shadcn.mdx), which uses a a combination of Tailwind CSS and Radix UI.
