# Getting started making a Miniapp

A Miniapp is just a JSON file. Part of this JSON is the manifest, defining things like the version and name, and other parts
are the elements rendered by the Miniapp, like a text or an image.

Our convention is to write Mini-apps in TypeScript, for better autocompletion and legibility, with the mini-apps being built to JSON.
You can take a look inside the `/miniapps` folder of [this repo](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod) to see how Mini-apps work

## Steps to make a new Miniapp

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod)
2. Create a new miniapp by duplicating an existing one in `/miniapps` or creating a new folder
3. Name your miniapp consistently between the folder name and the `slug` in the `manifest.ts` file
4. Create the elements of your miniapp
5. Add your miniapp to `/packages/miniapp-registry/src/index.ts`
6. Add any api backend your miniapp needs to `/examples/api/src/app`
7. Submit a Pull request
