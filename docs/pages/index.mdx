# Introduction

Mod is a standard for creating apps that live inside of other apps. We call this a Module, or Mod in short. Mod currently only supports the Farcaster protocol, and Mods can be one of two kinds: Mods for creating content, or Mods for displaying rich embeds.
Mods are currently defined via a JSON configuration file, and are reviewed and approved into the registry on a case by case basis to ensure security, performance and quality.

## Why?

We're deeply passionate about social because, despite being the most broken part of the internet, it's one of the greatest technologies of our time. If we want a prosperous and free internet, we need to reduce the barriers for people to create new social experiences, and the best shot at succeeding we have today is through decentralized social protocols.
Mods are an accessible medium for people to easily build new social experiences.

## Design goals

The User Experience is the most important design goal for us while designing Mod.
We think that the key drivers of UX for Mod are: Consistency, Simplicity, Security, Speed and Depth of Integration.

## Vision & Roadmap

We want to enable a million Mods made by thousands of devs.

Mod's goal is to become a sustainable internet public good, by becoming a protocol and standard.

Mod plans to support other decentralized protocols natively, move the storage of Mods to decentralized technologies and support richer APIs, such that Mods can hook into the full lifecycle of an app.

Mod may make it possible for future Mod creators to token gate access to Mods, as well as the ability for creators to earn a share of transactions facilitated by their Mods.
