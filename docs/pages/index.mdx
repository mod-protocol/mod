**Mod helps you replace external links with actions that users can take within your app.**
That means:
- Allow users to transact, mint, swap, create, play from within your app, instead of users leaving your site.
- Mod helps you make money with referral fees from protocols like Zora that your users interact with.
- Mod helps you drive DAU numbers by delighting your users with new experiences, and keeping them in your app.
- Mod is an open source standard, set of SDKs, and marketplace of Mods made by developers like you.
