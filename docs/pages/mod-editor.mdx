# Farcaster Editor

A fully featured, performant, and open source Cast creator for your React app.

<Image src="/mod-editor.png" alt="mod-editor example" width="400" height="200" />

## Why should you use this and not build your own cast creator?

- We've spent over 100 hours on this open source library to get it just right for your Farcaster app.
- It supports: @ mentions, channels, link highlighting & automatic embeds, image, url and video embeds, max lengths in bytes, open graph previews, textcuts
- You can easily use Mods that allow users to add Rich Embeds like image uploads, video uploads or choosing a GIF.
- It's [open source](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod/tree/main/packages/react-editor), MIT licensed and designed to put you in full control - you choose which if any Mods you want to use with it. 
- You can and are free to use this even if you aren't integrating Mod - it doesn't depend on any of Mod's core SDKs.
- It's lightweight, treeshakeable and performant, built on tiptap and prosemirror. It's extendable with your own Mods or tiptap plugins if you'd like.
- It's unopinionated about UI and works with your UI library

## Usage 

```tsx
import { useEditor, EditorContent } from "@mod-protocol/react-editor";
import { EmbedsEditor } from "@mod-protocol/react-ui-shadcn/dist/lib/embeds";
import { fetchUrlMetadata } from "@mod-protocol/core";
import { getFarcasterChannels, getFarcasterMentions } from "@mod-protocol/farcaster";

// use our API_URL, self host our API, or use your own API.
const getUrlMetadata = fetchUrlMetadata(API_URL);
const getResults = getFarcasterMentions(API_URL);
const getChannels = getFarcasterChannels(API_URL);

 // ...
 const { editor, getEmbeds, setEmbeds, handleSubmit, getText, setChannel, getChannel } = useEditor({
    fetchUrlMetadata: getUrlMetadata,
    onError: (error) => console.error(error),
    onSubmit: (cast) => console.log(cast), // submit to your hub
    linkClassName: "text-blue-600",
    renderMentionsSuggestionConfig: createRenderMentionsSuggestionConfig({
      getResults: getResults,
    }),
  });
  return (
    <>
        <EditorContent
          editor={editor}
          autoFocus
          className="w-full h-full min-h-[200px]"
        />
        <EmbedsEditor embeds={getEmbeds()} setEmbeds={setEmbeds} />
        <ChannelPicker
          getChannels={getChannels}
          onSelect={setChannel}
