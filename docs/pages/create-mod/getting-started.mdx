# Getting started making a Mod

A Mod consists of a manifest JSON file and optionally a backend which can handle requests from the Mod and make external requests. 
The Manifest contains metadata about the Mod, such as it's name and unique identifier, which Mod Elements it renders onto the page, and conditions under which to render them.

Our convention is to write Mods in TypeScript, for better autocompletion and legibility, with the Mods being built to JSON.
You can take a look inside the `/mods` folder of [this repo](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod) to see how Mods work

## Steps to make a new Mod

1. Fork [this repo](https://github.com/mod-protocol/mod)
2. Create a new mod by duplicating an existing one in `/mods` or creating a new folder
3. Name your mod consistently between the folder name and the `slug` in the `manifest.ts` file
4. Create the elements of your mod
5. Add your mod to `/packages/mod-registry/src/index.ts` or load it directly into the `RichEmbed` `mods` array or `CreationMod` `renderers`
6. Add any api backend your mod needs to `/examples/api/src/app`
7. Submit a Pull request
