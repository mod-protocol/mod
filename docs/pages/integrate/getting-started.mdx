## Integration options

You can integrate as much or as little of Mod as you'd like, as Mod supports progressive adoption.

You also have free choice of which Mods you want to support in your App. You can pick and choose from our open source ones, or even build and bring your own.

There are three kinds of Mods currently:

1. [Creation Mods](creation.mdx): Enable users to use Mods when creating a post, such as Mods for adding Gifs, Images, Videos, Polls or using AI.
   You can integrate these with or without the Mod Editor, which is a great Farcaster cast creator with batteries included.
2. [Rich-embed Mods](rich-embeds.mdx): Turn urls into rich embeds, with a fallback to an open graph style card embed. These enable Images, Videos, Polls, Games, Minting NFTs,
   or any other mini-interaction to happen directly in the interface.
   You can integrate these with or without the Mod Metadata Cache.
3. [Post Action Mods](post-actions.mdx): Enable users to use Mods when interacting with posts, such as Mods for tipping, sharing, traslating or other mini-interactions that require the context of the post such as its author and contents.
   You can integrate these with or without the Mod Metadata Cache.

## Support

Mod currently only has SDKs for React, and we're working on adding React-native support.
